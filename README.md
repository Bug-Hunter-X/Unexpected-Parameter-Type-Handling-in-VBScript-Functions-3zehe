This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: improper handling of parameter types in functions. VBScript's dynamic typing can lead to unexpected runtime errors if functions aren't designed to gracefully handle various input types. The `bug.vbs` file shows a function vulnerable to these errors. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version with robust type checking.
